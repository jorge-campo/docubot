<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only change your Keycard PIN with the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

The Keycard PIN functions as a password for your Keycard. You can change it at any time as long as you know the current Keycard PIN.

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you enter the wrong PIN three times, your Keycard locks. You need to [unlock it](./unlock-your-keycard.mdx) or [perform a factory reset](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx). Your funds are safe as long as you know the [recovery phrase](./understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-recovery-phrase).
