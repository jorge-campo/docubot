<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only unlock your Keycard on the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

To prevent unauthorized access, your Keycard locks itself after entering a wrong PIN three times. To keep using your Keycard, you must unlock it.

## What to expect

- Once unlocked, your Keycard is ready for use, just like before it was locked.
- To unlock the Keycard, you can use the [recovery phrase](./understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) of the profile or Wallet accounts on your Keycard, or the [Keycard PUK](./create-a-keycare-puk.mdx).
- If you don't remember your recovery phrase or Keycard PUK, read [If you lost your recovery phrase and Keycard PUK](#if-you-lose-your-recovery-phrase-and-keycard-puk).

## If you lose your recovery phrase and Keycard PUK

If you don't remember the recovery phrase of the profile or Wallet accounts on your Keycard, and you didn't set a Keycard PUK or you lose the PUK, you can't unlock your Keycard. Therefore, if you are not signed in to your Status profile, you lose access to your Status data and wallet funds forever.

If you're still signed in to your Status profile, you may be able to save the wallet funds by [sending them to a different address](../wallet/send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) using your [biometrics on Status desktop](./enable-biometrics-for-your-status-profile.mdx).

Although you can't use the Keycard with the current profile or Wallet accounts, you can still use it to set up a new profile or Wallet accounts. To do this, first you need to [factory reset the Keycard](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx). The factory reset erases all data, including the private key of the current profile or Wallet accounts on the Keycard.

  If your Keycard is not locked, but you lose the recovery phrase and Keycard PUK, you can still access your Status profile or Wallet accounts. However, to protect your funds and profile data, should use a new profile or Wallet account. To learn how to do it, see [If you lose your recovery phrase](../profile/if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx#if-you-lost-your-recovery-phrase-but-know-your-status-password).
