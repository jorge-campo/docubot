<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

To use your existing wallet account with Status Wallet, import either your recovery phrase or private key. Both options are valid and retrieve the same account for you.

{/*
  The key difference is that if you import your recovery phrase, you can choose to set a [custom derivation path](./about-custom-derivation-paths.mdx). You can't do this with your private key. If you don't want to change your addresses, it doesn't matter whether you import your recovery phrase or private key.

## Import an account using your private key

A private key is a string of letters and numbers that allows you to access and manage your crypto.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Never share your private key with anyone. Whoever has your private key can access and manage your crypto. Status will never ask you for your key, and anyone who does is trying to steal your profile and wallet funds.
