    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Whether you're a community Owner or a member, you can invite anyone to any channel you're a member of. For token-gated channels, the person you invite must hold the required token to join the channel.

    [Admonition: Info]
    To join the channel, the person you invite must be a community member.


## Invite options
