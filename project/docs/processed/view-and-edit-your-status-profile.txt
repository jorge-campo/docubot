    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, you can't edit some profile sections on Status desktop. Use the Status mobile app to edit them.


Your profile serves as a showcase of who you are to other Status users. You can make as many edits as you need, and the profile updates take effect instantly.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Your Status profile and messages are temporarily saved in the [Waku](https://waku.org) peer-to-peer network and stored permanently on your device. They are not saved on the blockchain or transmitted via the Ethereum network.


    [Admonition: Tip]
    To see how your profile appears to others, check out [View your profile as someone else](./view-your-profile-as-someone-else.mdx).
