    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, you can only customize your channel notifications in the Status mobile app.


When using the Status app, you can customize how you receive notifications in direct messages (DMs), group chats or communities.

For example, you may want to receive notifications for mentions in group chats but not in communities, or you may want to receive DM notifications only in the [Status notification center](./your-status-notifications-guide.mdx).

Here are the notifications you can customize:

    [Table]
    | Notifications | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Personal mentions | Messages that specifically mention you. For example, someone tags you in a group chat. |
    | Global mentions | Messages directed to the entire community. For example, an announcement in a channel or group chat tagged with "@everyone" or "@here" that notifies all members. |
    | All other messages | Any message that isn't a Personal or Global Mention. For example, a message in a group chat or channel you're in that isn't tagged with your name or isn't an announcement. |

    [Admonition: Tip]
    You can further customize the notifications you receive using [exceptions](./set-up-and-customize-notification-exceptions.mdx).


## Customize mentions and all other messages notifications

You can customize how you receive notifications for personal and global mentions and all other messages.

[Tab 1 Instructions]
1. From the tab bar, tap "Communities" to customize your community or channel notifications, or tap "Messages" to customize your group chat or DM notifications.
1. Tap the community, channel, group chat or DM you want to set up notifications for and, in the top navigation, tap "More options".
1. Tap "Notification settings".
1. Select "Personal mentions", "Global mentions" or "All other messages".
1. Choose your preferred notification setting:

    [Table]
    | Setting | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Notification on | Turn this on if you want to see notifications banners. |
    | In notification centre only | Turn this option on to receive the notifications in the Status notification centre. You need to unlock your phone to see the notifications. |
    | Notifications off | Turn this on if you don't want to receive notifications. |

    [Admonition: Tip]
    You can configure the same notification setting for DMs, group chats or communities using the "Same settings for all message types" option.


## How to disable on-screen notifications

On-screen notifications appear as banners on your device's screen when you're actively using it or when the screen is locked.

You can disable on-screen notifications for new messages within the Status app. This may be useful when you plan to attend a public event and you don't want your notifications to show on the screen.

[Tab 1 Instructions]
1. From the tab bar, tap "Communities" to customize your community or channel notifications, or tap "Messages" to customize your group chat or DM notifications.
1. Tap the community, channel, group chat or DM you want to set up notifications for and, in the top navigation, tap "More options".
1. Tap "Notification settings".
1. Turn on "Same settings for all message types".
1. Select "In notification centre only".
[Tab 2 Instructions]
1. From the navigation sidebar, click "Settings".
1. From the "Settings sidebar", click  "Notifications and Sounds".
1. Under the "Message" area, Select  "Deliver Quietly" for "Personal mentions", "Global mentions" and "All messages" using the drop-down menu.
