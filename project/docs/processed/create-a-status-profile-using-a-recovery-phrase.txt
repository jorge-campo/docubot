title: Create a Status profile using a recovery phrase
author: jorge-campo

    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


You can use your existing Ethereum address to create a new Status profile. For instance, if you already have a [non-custodial Ethereum wallet](../wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, you already have an Ethereum address and a [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx).

    [Admonition: Tip]
    If you want to use your Status profile on multiple devices, [sync your device](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) for the best experience.


## What to expect

- Your wallet funds are safe and recoverable as long as you know your recovery phrase and [keep it safe](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx).
- When you create a profile using an existing Ethereum address that already has funds, you can operate with your funds using [Status Wallet](../wallet/how-to-use-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx).
- If you already have a Status profile created with the same recovery phrase, and you have used it within the past 30 days, you can choose to recover it or continue with the new profile.
- If you haven't used Status in the past 30 days, your profile is unrecoverable on new devices. You have to sign in from the device you used the profile to recover it. Your funds are safe if you know the recovery phrase.

## Create a profile using a recovery phrase

[Mobile Instructions]
### Step 1: Enter your recovery phrase words

1. Open the Status app and check the box to accept the Status "Terms of Use and Privacy Policy" and tap "Create profile".
1. Tap "Share usage data" or "Not now". If you use mobile data, you may see a pop-up window to set up data syncing connection for your profile. Choose "Mobile and Wi-Fi" or "Wi-Fi only".
1. On the following screen, select "Use recovery phrase".
1. Enter the 12, 18 or 24 words in your recovery phrase, separated by a space, and tap "Continue".
1. Status suggests matching words as you type. To speed up the recovery phrase entry, tap the right suggestion.
1. Tap "Continue".
1. [Customize your Status profile](#customize-your-profile) with your preferred name, profile picture, and colour, and press "Continue".

### Step 2: Create your password

1. Enter and repeat your password. Check the box to confirm "I understand my password can't be recovered" and tap "Confirm password".
1. Configure your device's biometrics (fingerprint, face or other) to fill in your password. If you want to enable biometrics later, tap "Maybe later".
1. Tap "Enable notifications" to set up Status app notifications. If you want to enable notifications later, tap "Maybe later" and then tap "Start using Status".
[Desktop Instructions]
### Step 1: Enter your recovery phrase words

1. Open the Status app. Your operating system may ask you to set your notification preferences for Status. If you see the "Status notifications" alert, click "Allow".
1. Check the box to accept the Status "Terms of Use and Privacy Policy" and click "Get Started". You can find and read this information on the [Status website](https://status.app).
1. On the welcome screen, click "I am new to Status".
1. Click "Share usage data" or "Do not share".
1. Click "Import a recovery phrase" and, on the next screen, click "Import a recovery phrase" again.
1. Enter the 12, 18 or 24 words in your recovery phrase.
1. Status auto-fills and suggests matching words as you type. To speed up the recovery phrase entry, click the right suggestion. Click "Import" when you finish.

### Step 2: Create your password and customize other settings

1. On the "Your profile" screen, [customize your Status profile](#customize-your-profile) with your preferred name, profile picture, and colour, and click "Next".
1. Enter and confirm your password and click "Create password".
1. Confirm your password again and click "Finalize Status Password Creation".
1. Enable your device's biometrics (fingerprint, face or other) to fill in your password. Alternatively, click "I prefer to use my password".
1. On the "Your emojihash and identicon ring" screen, you can learn more about your Status profile. Click "Next".
1. Click "Start using Status".

If Status finds an existing profile in the [Waku network](../messaging/about-status-messages.mdx#understand-peer-to-peer-messaging), you can use your existing profile or the one you have just created. When you choose your existing profile, [sync this profile](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) with your other device if you have one.

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Status doesn't know your password and can't reset it for you. If you forget your password, you may lose access to your Status profile.    Remember your Status password, keep it in a safe place and don't share it with anyone.
