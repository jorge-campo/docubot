    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


To receive crypto, you need to share one of your account addresses in your Status Wallet with the sender. You can either send them your address or show them your address's QR code. For more details, check out [Receive crypto](./receive-crypto.mdx).

    [Admonition: Caution]
    You should only share your public address (which starts with `0x` and is 42 characters long) with others. Never share any other data with anyone. For more details, check out [Understand common scams](./understand-common-scams.mdx).


## Your legacy and multi-chain addresses

In essence, your legacy and multi-chain addresses are the same address. The key difference is that your multi-chain address lists the blockchain networks you want to receive crypto on. For more details, check out [About your multi-chain and legacy addresses](./about-your-multi-chain-and-legacy-addresses.mdx).
