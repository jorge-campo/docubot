    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    You can only airdrop tokens using the Status desktop app.


When you [mint the Owner token](./mint-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx), you're minting the TokenMaster token simultaneously. After minting, you can airdrop the TokenMaster token to other members so that they can help you manage your community.

    [Admonition: Info]
    To understand the function of these two tokens in your community, check out [Understand the Owner and TokenMaster tokens](./understand-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx).


Airdropping the TokenMaster token is similar to [airdropping other tokens](./how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status.mdx) in Status. You can airdrop the token to community and non-community members.

The TokenMaster token has an âˆž infinite supply. This means you can airdrop the token as often as you want and don't need to mint new TokenMaster tokens.

## What to expect

- Only the community Owner can mint and airdrop the TokenMaster token.
- When you airdrop the TokenMaster token to someone, you grant them the [TokenMaster role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) and all the permissions this role has.
- You can [revoke the TokenMaster role](./revoke-the-tokenmaster-role-from-someone.mdx) anytime by destructing the token remotely.
- You can airdrop the TokenMaster token on the same network where you minted it. For example, if you minted the token on the Optimism network, you can only airdrop it using Optimism.
- The network where the airdrop takes place charges you the [airdrop transaction fee](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx). Status doesn't charge any fee for airdrops.
