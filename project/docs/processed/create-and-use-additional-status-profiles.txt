    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Using your Status profile, you can access and use the different Status app features. Unlike traditional centralized apps, which require personal information like a phone number to sign up, Status doesn't ask you for any personal information.

You can create multiple profiles for different purposes. For example, you may want to use different profiles for work, social activities and connecting with families.

    [Admonition: Info]
    If you want to remove a profile, read [Remove a Status profile](./remove-a-status-profile-from-your-profile-list.mdx).
