The [Ethereum blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) has two networks: Mainnet and testnet. Ethereum Mainnet is the primary network where actual transactions occur with real crypto.

Developers use Ethereum testnet for testing, which doesn't involve real crypto. In testnet mode, they can experiment with features and functionalities without risking their crypto.

When you run Status, your Wallet and token actions occur in the Ethereum Mainnet by default. This means you handle real cryptocurrencies and perform transactions on the main Ethereum network.

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Ethereum testnet mode is intended only for advanced users and developers.


## What to expect

- Don't enable testnet on your main Status installation. Use another computer or virtual machine with a different Status profile.
- When you enable the Ethereum testnet, everything in the Status app runs on testnet, including the communities you create or are part of.
- Don't mix Ethereum testnet and Mainet under the same Status profile. Doing so can lead to unexpected issues with your profile and communities.
