When you join a community, you share one or more Status Wallet accounts. This action confirms you have the tokens for token-gated communities or channels and lets you participate in airdrops or fulfill a [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx).

No matter which [type of community](./about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) you want to join, you must share at least one Wallet account address (or address, for short) with the [community control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx). If you have only one address, it's automatically selected when joining the community and you can't unselect this address.

    [Admonition: Info]
    The community control node stores the addresses you share. These addresses are never revealed to the community Owner or members. However, the community Owner might discover the address and address owner indirectly.


## What to expect

- You choose the Wallet account addresses you share with a community when you join it. You can [change these addresses](./change-the-wallet-account-you-share-with-a-community.mdx) at any time.
- Consider creating [dedicated addresses](../wallet/create-wallet-accounts.mdx) for specific communities to protect your security and privacy.
- To maintain access to a token-gated community or channel, you must share the address with the required tokens at all times.
- When you [join a community](./join-a-community-on-status-web.mdx), the Status app selects the role (member, Admin or TokenMaster) with more privileges based on the tokens you own. You can change your role by sharing a different address.
- Your [community role](./permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.mdx) might change depending on the tokens you hold on the shared address. For example, if you share an address with the [TokenMaster token](./understand-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx), you become a TokenMaster. If you unselect an address with administration tokens, you lose your [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) and become a member.
