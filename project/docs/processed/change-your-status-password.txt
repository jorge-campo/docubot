When you create a new Status profile, you set a password to protect your profile and Wallet accounts. You can change this password at any time.

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password, you may lose access to your Status profile. Check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](./if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx) for more information.


## What to expect

- To set a new password, you must know the current password.
- The password is profile-specific. It only works for the current profile if you have multiple profiles on your device.
- The password is device-specific. It only works for your current device. If you have logged in to your profile on multiple devices, the password for other devices remains unchanged.
- If you set up [syncing](./sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) for your profile, your password is not synced across devices. For more information, check out [About changing your Status password](./about-changing-your-status-password.mdx).

    [Admonition: Tip]
    After changing your password on one device, always update the password on each device where you use Status. This ensures all your devices stay secure and in sync.
