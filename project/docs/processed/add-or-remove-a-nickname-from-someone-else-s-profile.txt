    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Nicknames are familiar or custom names you can assign to people you interact with in Status. Nicknames offer a practical solution for remembering names that may be difficult to recall or distinguish.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Nicknames you add to others are personal and only visible to you.


When you assign a nickname to someone, the Status app prioritizes displaying the nickname over the original name chosen by the contact. The nickname and the contact's original name are always visible.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    You can give nicknames to anyone in Status, not only your contacts. You can't add a nickname to yourself.
