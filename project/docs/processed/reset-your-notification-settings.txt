    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


If you set custom notification settings before, but you don't receive the notifications you expect any more, you can reset your settings. Doing so removes any exceptions, and the notification settings return to their default values.
