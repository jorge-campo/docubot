In Status Communities, Owners and TokenMasters can [mint new tokens](./mint-tokens-for-your-community.mdx) and use them to set [token-based](./token-based-access-to-communities-and-channels.mdx) communities and channels or [delegate permissions](./delegate-management-functions-to-your-community.mdx) to other members.

In addition to minting new tokens, Owners and TokenMasters can import existing ERC-20 tokens to their community. Importing is useful if you want to use one of the tokens in token lists such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) instead of your own minted token.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Token lists are directories of verified crypto tokens that platforms like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) or [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) keep. These lists include token names, symbols and contract addresses to help users interact with tokens securely.


## What to expect

- You import a new token to your community when you set up a new community or channel permission.
- The tokens you import appear in your personal settings under the navigation sidebar "Settings" > "Wallet" > "Manage tokens" option.
- Owners and TokenMasters can import assets (virtual currencies, such as DAI or UNI) to their community. Currently, it is not possible to import existing  collectibles (NFTs).

    [Admonition: Info]
    Adding your own list of tokens is not supported yet. You can only add tokens to your community by minting them or importing them from the Uniswap or Status token lists.


## Import tokens to your community

[Desktop Instructions]
1. From the navigation sidebar, click your community.
1. On top of the channel sidebar, click your community logo and then click "Permissions".
1. Click "Add new permission" to start from scratch or click "Duplicate" to start from an existing permission.
1. For the "Who holds" variable, click "Add" next to the variable and choose the asset you want to import. The list includes your community assets (if you have minted any) and all other available assets.
1. Enter the amount of assets you want to use in your permission and click "Add".
1. Configure the rest of the permission options using the "Is allowed to" and "In" variables.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    Check out [Set up your community permissions](./set-up-your-community-permissions.mdx) or [Set up your channel permissions](set-up-your-channel-permissions.mdx) for a step-by-step guide on how to configure permissions.
