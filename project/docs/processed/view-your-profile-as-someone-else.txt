    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Your Status profile can reveal a lot about you. It's important to check if you're sharing the right details with the right people. For example, you may want to share more information with your Status contacts than with non-contacts.

## View your profile as someone else

The desktop version only shows a limited preview of your profile. Instead, use the mobile version.

[Mobile Instructions]
1. From the tab bar, tap "Messages".
1. Tap your profile picture.
1. Tap "Reveal".
1. Tap the "Arrow" to view your profile as "Everyone", "Contact" or "Verified contact".
[Desktop Instructions]
1. From the navigation sidebar, click "Settings".
1. Click "Profile".
1. In the "Profile" content area, select "Preview".

    [Admonition: Tip]
    If you want to make any changes, check out [View and edit your Status profile](./view-and-edit-your-status-profile.mdx).
