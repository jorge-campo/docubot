    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    Sharing images is not available on Status Web.


In Status, you can share images in DMs (direct messages), group chats and channels. When you share an image, other participants can download, react or reply to it.

Unlike other messaging apps that use a centralized server, Status protects your privacy by using a [peer-to-peer network](./about-status-messages.mdx) to deliver your messages. Because of this, you can only send a certain number of images per message. To share more images, simply send extra messages, each with its own set of images.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, sharing files isn't possible on the Status peer-to-peer network.
