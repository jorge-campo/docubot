    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


By default, you receive notifications for direct messages (DMs). You can customize the DM chat notifications and receive only the ones relevant to you.

In addition to DM chat notifications, you also receive notifications for mentions. For example, if you mute someone, they can still mention you in a community channel or group chat. To customize your mention notifications, read [Customize mentions and other messages](./customize-mentions-and-other-messages-notifications.mdx).
