    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Your Status password protects both your Status profile and associated Wallet accounts. Scenarios such as switching to another profile or signing transactions require your password.

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password, you may lose access to your Status profile and wallet funds. If you lose your password, check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](./if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx) for more information.


You can change your password at any time. However, unlike centralized services that store your password centrally, Status operates on a [peer-to-peer network](../messaging/about-status-messages.mdx#understand-peer-to-peer-messaging) and doesn't transfer your password through this network. Your password stays local to the device where you set it.

This means that if you change your password on one device, you need to manually update it on all devices where you use the same Status profile. If not, you must use the previous password to access your Status profile on those devices.

    [Admonition: Info]
    When you set up syncing, the Status app transfers your password to the new device using the QR code or sync code, so you can use the password on your new device.


This table outlines how your actions involving your password affect its use.

    [Table]
    | Action | What happens |
    |---|---|
    | Enter your password in the Status app | To sign in to your profile, sign a transaction, and perform other security-sensitive actions within the app, you need to enter your password. Status never asks for your recovery phrase for these purposes. |
    | Sign in to your profile on a new device by syncing | The password syncs to the new device and you don't need to set a password or update the password. |
    | Sign in to your profile on a new device using the recovery phrase | The Status app requires you to set a new password on the new device. To simplify your login process, use the same password as on your primary device. If you enter a different password, they will independently on two devices. |
    | Change your password on one device for one profile | The new password only works for this specific profile on the device where you change it. To simplify your login process, update your password for this profile on other devices in sync. |

    [Admonition: Tip]
