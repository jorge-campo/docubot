Once you [create your Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx#create-a-new-status-profile), you automatically get a Status Wallet account. You can create extra accounts if you want to. For example, you can use them to save towards specific goals or to keep track of your short-term and long-term token investments.

    [Admonition: Info]
    To import your existing crypto account, check out [Import an account into your Status Wallet](./import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx).


## About your wallet accounts

Your Status Wallet accounts are all associated with the same [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx). If you [lose your recovery phrase](../profile/if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx), you can lose access to all your Status Wallet accounts.

Each account has a different [Ethereum address](./about-your-wallet-accounts-and-addresses.mdx). This means that to transfer crypto between your accounts, you need to [send crypto](./send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) to them the same way as you would send it to someone else's wallet.
