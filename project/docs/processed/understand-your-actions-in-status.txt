    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Status is an open-source, decentralized crypto communication app. This article walks you through the actions you can perform within Status and highlights important points to consider.

## Wallet

    [Table]
    | Action | What happens |
    |---|---|
    | [Use Status Wallet with a Keycard hardware wallet](../profile/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) | Protect your funds by storing the private keys of your Wallet accounts offline in an air-gapped environment. |
    | [Create Wallet accounts](../wallet/create-wallet-accounts.mdx) | Once you create a Status profile, you also get a Wallet account. You can create additional accounts to save towards your goals and keep track of your assets. |
    | [Import an account into your Status Wallet](../wallet/import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx) | If you already have a crypto account, you can import it into Status to store, receive and send crypto assets. You can also add [watch-only accounts](../wallet/add-watch-only-accounts.mdx) to keep track of their transactions. |
    | Share your account address in Status Wallet | Sharing your address is safe. Others can't access your funds using just your address. But anyone who has your address can view your transaction history. |
    | [Buy crypto](../wallet/buy-crypto.mdx) | You can browse and buy crypto assets in Status. |
    | [Send crypto to someone](../wallet/send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) | Once the transaction is complete, you can't revert it. |
    | [Swap crypto](../wallet/swap-crypto-in-status-wallet.mdx) | Exchange one type of crypto for another. |
    | [Bridge crypto](../wallet/bridge-crypto-in-status-wallet.mdx) | You can transfer your crypto assets from one blockchain to another. |
    | [Set custom network fees](../wallet/set-custom-network-fees.mdx) | The speed of your transaction changes according to the [network fee](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx) (gas fee) you pay. |

## Profile and preferences

    [Table]
    | Action | What happens |
    |---|---|
    | [Use Status profile with a Keycard hardware wallet](../profile/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) | Protect your profile and your Status Wallet by storing the private keys of your Wallet accounts offline in an air-gapped environment. |
    | [Sync your profile across devices](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) | Once you set up the syncing, your Status profile data on your devices are in sync automatically until you unpair the devices. |
    | [Create additional Status profiles](../profile/create-and-use-additional-status-profiles.mdx) | The login screen shows multiple profiles. Each profile has its own recovery phrase and password. You can switch profiles from the "Profiles" option. |
    | [View your profile as someone else](../profile/view-your-profile-as-someone-else.mdx) | You can see what your profile looks like to the public, your Status contacts or verified contacts. |
    | [Remove a Status profile from your profile list](../profile/remove-a-status-profile-from-your-profile-list.mdx) | The Status profile disappears from your profile list on this device. The associated profile data is deleted from this device. If you want the profile to appear again, log in within 30 days. |
    | [Mute your non-messaging notifications](../profile/customize-mentions-and-other-messages-notifications.mdx) | You get notifications for incoming messages but not for other activities in Status. |
    | [Log out of Status](../profile/log-out-of-status.mdx) | Your Status profile is logged out from the current device. If you don't log into the profile for 30 days or more (on any device), your crypto funds are safe, but your profile is irrecoverably lost. |

## Contacts

    [Table]
    | Action | What happens |
    |---|---|
    | [Verify a contact](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx) | The contact receives your verification request with your question. You can label the contact as trusted or untrusted based on the answer. |
    | [Label a contact as trusted or untrusted](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx) | You see the corresponding label on the contact's profile. Labeling a contact does not notify the contact. |
    | [Reject a contact request](../profile/respond-to-a-contact-request.mdx) | Rejecting a contact request does not notify the sender. However, the user can send you a new request every seven days. |
    | [Block a Status user](../profile/block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx) | Blocked users can't send you messages. Status permanently deletes all messages sent by the blocked user for you. |
    | [Unblock a Status user](../profile/block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx) | Your communication with the user resumes, but you can't see the messages deleted after blocking the user again. |
    | [Remove a Status contact](../profile/remove-a-contact-from-status.mdx) | Your direct messages with the user remain. The user can send you a contact request again. |

## Messaging

    | Send a [DM to a contact](../messaging/send-direct-messages-to-your-contacts.mdx) or [a group of contacts](../messaging/create-a-group-chat.mdx) | Only the contact or the group of contacts can receive and view your message. |

    | [Close a chat](../messaging/close-a-chat-with-someone.mdx) | The chat disappears from your chats list. It reappears either when the contact sends you a new message or when you decide to send a new message to the contact. |
    | [Delete a message](../messaging/edit-and-delete-messages.mdx) | You can delete your messages anytime, for yourself or everyone. If the recipients don't get online after you send the message, this message remains in their devices. |
    | [Clear the chat history](../messaging/clear-the-chat-history.mdx) | If you clear a chat history, you're clearing all messages in the direct message (DM) chat, group chat or community channel just for yourself. Everyone else can still see the full history. |
