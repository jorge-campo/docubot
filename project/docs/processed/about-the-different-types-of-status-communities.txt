    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


In Status, there are different types of communities, and your ability to access them depends on three factors that work independently: token requirements, join requirements and discoverability.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Private communities are not visible or discoverable on the communities [Discover page](./how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx#discover-communities). You can only join a private community by [importing an invite link](./import-a-community-someone-shares-with-you.mdx) or receiving an invite from a community member.


## Types of Status Communities

    [Table]
    | Community | Requirement | Access managed by | Note |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Token-gated | [Token requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-communities.mdx) | Community Owner, TokenMasters or admins | To join and maintain access, you must hold the required tokens by [buying crypto](../wallet/buy-crypto.mdx) or receiving them from others. |
    | Open | None | N/A | You are not required to hold any specific tokens to join. |
    | Join approval required | [Join approval](./about-community-request-approvals.mdx) | Community Owner, TokenMasters or admins | You need to wait for the community Owner, TokenMaster or Admin to approve your join request. |
    | Join approval not required | None | N/A | You can join the communities directly if you meet the token requirements or there's no token requirement. |
    | Private | You need a community member to invite you to join. | Community Owner, TokenMasters or admins | The community doesn't appear on the Discover page in Communities.    SNT holders can vote to [change the community visibility](./about-voting-to-change-the-community-visibility.mdx). |
    | Public | None | N/A | The community appears on the Discover page in Communities.    SNT holders can vote to [change the community visibility](./about-voting-to-change-the-community-visibility.mdx). |

    [Admonition: Info]
    When you create a community, it's open and private by default.


## Communities examples

Imagine you're a fan of a digital artist who manages a Status Community. This community is specifically for those who own the artist's issued collectibles (NFTs). In this case, the artist's community could be token-gated using the artist's collectibles, public and with no approval to join. Thus, the artist could build a larger fan base more quickly.

Consider another situation where your organization plans to run a Status Community only for its members. To restrict access to unrelated individuals, your organization could create a token-gated community and require approval for joining. If the organization prefers to stay unnoticed by the public, it could advocate for the community to stay private.
