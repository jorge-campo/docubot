    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


You can import a Status Community that someone [shares with you](./invite-people-to-a-status-community.mdx) using the community link, QR code or public key. Importing a community can be helpful when you want to join a [private community](./about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) that is not listed in the communities [Discover page](./how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx#discover-communities).

    [Admonition: Info]
    If you're a community Owner and want to recover your community on a different device, read [Recover your Status Community](./recover-your-status-community.mdx).


## Options to import a community

You have three options to import a Status Community.

    [Table]
    | Option | Description | Works with |
    |---|---|---|
    | Link | Tap or click the Status Community link to open the community page. | Mobile and desktop |
    | QR code | Use this option to scan the community QR code someone shares with you. | Mobile |
    | Community public key | Import the key using the Status app to find the community you want to join. | Mobile and desktop |

Use the community link, QR code or public key to find and import the community you're interested in. The community link contains the community public key at the end. For example, for the community link `https://status.app/cc/G8gAA[...]dy9L9`, the public key is `G8gAA[...]dy9L9`.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    The community link contains the community public key at the end, so you don't have to type it in.
