    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, you can only search for conversations and messages in the Status desktop app.


In the Status app, you can search for specific conversations ([direct messages](./send-direct-messages-to-your-contacts.mdx), [group chats](./create-a-group-chat.mdx) and [channels](../communities/channels-your-quick-start-guide.mdx)) as well as text within those conversations.

## What to Expect

- The [message search](#search-for-messages) function only includes messages in your chat window, including those you can scroll through. Older messages beyond this may not appear.
- You can search messages in [token-gated communities and channels](../communities/token-based-access-to-communities-and-channels.mdx) as long as you're a community member with access to the channel.
- On Status desktop, you can use keyboard shortcuts or the "Search" option in the user interface.
