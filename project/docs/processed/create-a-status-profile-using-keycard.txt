    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


When you create a Status profile, the Status app generates [cryptographic keys](./understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) for your profile authentication and authorization. Using a [Keycard](./keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx), the app generates and stores these keys on your Keycard, permanently offline and isolated from the internet.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    If you don't have a Keycard, you can [get one](https://status.app/keycard) or [create your Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx) without a Keycard.


Your Keycard stores the cryptographic keys for your Status profile and also secures your Wallet accounts. However, it doesn't store your Status profile data such as your Status contacts, profile settings or community membership. This data stays on your device until the app is uninstalled, and is temporarily stored in the [Waku peer-to-peer network](https://waku.org).

## What to expect

- You need an empty Keycard to create a Status profile. If your Keycard is not new, [view the wallet accounts on your Keycard](./view-the-wallet-accounts-on-your-keycard.mdx) and [factory reset](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx) the Keycard if you no longer need the accounts.
- You need a [card reader](./keycard-faq.mdx) to connect the Keycard to your computer.
- After you create the profile with a Keycard, you must use the same Keycard or biometrics for authentication in the Status app.
- Your Keycard stores the cryptographic keys for your Status profile and Wallet but doesn't store your Status profile data.

## Create a Status profile using Keycard

[Mobile Instructions]
### Step 1: Prepare your Keycard

1. Open the Status app and tap "Create profile".
1. On the following screen, tap "Agree" to share basic usage data with Status or tap "Maybe later".
1. Tap "Use an empty Keycard" and then tap "Scan Keycard". Hold or place your Keycard near the top (iPhone) or back (Android phones) of your phone.
1. On the screen that confirms your "Keycard is empty" tap "Let's go".

    [Admonition: Tip]
    Remove your phone case during the Keycard setup process to ensure a successful connection.


### Step 2: Set up your Keycard

1. If your Keycard has a PIN, enter it and scan your Keycard again. Status adds your keys to the Keycard.

1. On the "Key pair added to Keycard" screen tap "Done".
1. Set up your device's biometrics (fingerprint, face or other method) to authenticate in addition to Keycard. If you want to enable biometrics later, tap "Maybe later".

    [Admonition: Info]
