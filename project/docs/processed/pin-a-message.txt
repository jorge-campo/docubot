    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


You can pin important information in chats so that it doesn't get lost in the message history. For example, you can pin your chat rules, event announcements or FAQ.

## The basics

- You can pin messages in DMs, group chats and community channels.
- Group chat members can pin both their own and other members' messages.
- Once you pin a message, it's highlighted and gets a label saying who pinned it.
- In communities, whether you can pin someone's message depends on [your role](../communities/permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.mdx#permissions-for-key-features) and the [settings](../communities/create-a-status-community.mdx#configure-additional-settings) chosen by the community owner.
