[Status Connector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kahehnbpamjplefhpkhafinaodkkenpg) is an open-source browser extension that you can use to connect to decentralized applications (dApps) directly from your desktop browser.

You can use Status Connector with Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, such as Brave, Edge or Opera.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Status Connector is not available for Firefox or Safari.


## Why use Status Connector

While [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network/) uses QR codes or deep links to establish a connection, Status Connector provides a direct link between your browser and the Status desktop app. This eliminates the need to scan QR codes and simplifies connecting to dApps and signing transactions.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Status Connector is available for the desktop browser only and requires the Status desktop app. If you need to connect to dApps on your mobile device, [use WalletConnect](./connect-to-dapps-using-walletconnect.mdx).


## Install Status Connector

### Step 1: Install the extension

1. Using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser, open the Status Connector extension [download page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kahehnbpamjplefhpkhafinaodkkenpg).
1. On the Status Connector page ("A wallet connector by Status"), click "Add to Chrome". If you are using a browser other than Google Chrome, the button may display "Add to \[browser]" or "Get extension" instead.
1. Click "Add Extension" in the pop-up window to confirm the installation.
1. If your browser asks you what you want to do with the extension, click "Open".

### Step 2: Make the extension visible in your browser

1. On your browser, locate the "Extensions" menu. This menu is a puzzle piece icon in the browser toolbar, typically in the top-right corner.
1. Click the puzzle piece icon to open the "Extensions" menu.
1. Click the pin icon next to the Status Connector extension to make it visible on the toolbar. In browsers like Edge, click the crossed eye icon to unhide the extension.

To use the extension, check out [Connect to dApps using the Status Connector extension](./connect-to-dapps-using-the-status-connector-extension.mdx).

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Only install the Status Connector extension from the official Chrome Web Store. Do not download the extension from third-party websites or unverified sources.


## Uninstall Status Connector

1. Locate the "Extensions" menu. This menu is a puzzle piece icon in the browser toolbar, typically in the top-right corner.
1. Right-click the Status Connector extension icon and choose "Remove from Chrome" or "Remove from \[browser name]".
