    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, you can only save addresses in the Status desktop app.


In Status Wallet, you can save addresses that you frequently send crypto to. This means you don't have to search for an address each time you want to send crypto to it. Instead, you can quickly choose it from your list of saved addresses.

## What to expect

- You can save addresses so that it's easier to send crypto to them. You're the only person who can see your saved addresses.
- When saving an address, you can also save the receiver's network preferences. For more details, check out [About your Status Wallet accounts and addresses](./about-your-status-wallet-accounts-and-addresses.mdx).
