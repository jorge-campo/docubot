    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


When you run Status for the first time, the app prompts you to create a Status profile and generates a pair of [cryptographic keys](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) representing your Status identity. Unlike centralized apps, Status doesn't rely on your username or email address to identify your profile. Instead, it uses your private and public keys.

If you want to create your profile from an existing recovery phrase, check out [Create a Status profile using a recovery phrase](./create-a-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.mdx). If you're going to use a Keycard to create your profile, check out [Create a Status profile using Keycard](../profile/create-a-status-profile-using-keycard.mdx).

    [Admonition: Info]
    To understand how these cryptographic keys work and how they protect your data and privacy, check out [Understand your Status keys and recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx).

To protect your Status data and funds, [back up and secure your recovery phrase](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx) immediately after creating your profile.

    [Admonition: Caution]
    Status doesn't know your password and can't reset it for you. If you forget
    your password, you may lose access to your Status profile.    Remember your Status password, keep it in a safe place and don't share it with
    anyone.
