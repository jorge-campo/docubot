    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


If you don't want to be a member of a [group chat](./understand-group-chats.mdx) anymore, you can leave the chat. You can always [re-join the chat](./join-a-group-chat.mdx) later if you change your mind.

When you leave, a note appears in the group chat's message history, letting other members know you are leaving the chat. After you leave, you can still view the group chat messages sent before.

If someone keeps adding you to group chats you don't want to be in, consider [changing who can invite you to group chats](./change-who-can-invite-you-to-group-chats.mdx) or [blocking that person](../profile/block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx).

    [Admonition: Info]
    The group chat owner can't leave without deleting the chat for everyone. For more information, check out [Delete a group chat](./delete-a-group-chat.mdx).
