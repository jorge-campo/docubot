    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


Instead of a centralized server, Status uses a [peer-to-peer network](./about-status-messages.mdx) to store and send messages. When you edit or delete a message, the peer-to-peer network distributes your changes to other users running the Status app.

In some cases, users may still see your original messages even after you edit or delete them. For example, some users can:

- Run an out-of-date version of Status that isn't fully compatible with the peer-to-peer network features.
- Run a custom build of Status that doesn't support message editing and deletion by choice.
- Disconnect from the network before receiving your latest changes.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Be careful with what you share, especially in communities and group chats. Once published to the network, what you shared may still remain on someone's device even if you choose to delete it later.


## What to expect

- You can edit and delete the messages you sent whenever you want: there is no time limit.
- Once you edit a text message, a permanent note appears next to your message saying it was edited.
- If you want to edit a message that contains images or audio, [delete](./edit-and-delete-messages.mdx#delete-your-messages) and re-send it.
- Once you delete a message, a permanent note appears where your message was saying it was deleted.
- Community Owners and group chat administrators can [delete someone else's messages](#delete-a-message-in-your-community-or-group-chat). If you don't hold these roles, you can only delete your own messages.
- In Status mobile, you can hide a message you don't want to see with "Delete for me". Everyone else can still see this message. To delete your message for everyone, select "Delete for everyone".

    [Admonition: Info]
    Your Status messages are temporarily saved in the [Waku](https://waku.org) peer-to-peer network and stored permanently on your device. They are not saved on the blockchain or transmitted via [Ethereum](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx).
