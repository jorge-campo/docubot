    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


In Status, you can reply to messages and react with emojis.

Replies are useful when you want to make it clear who you are responding to, as well as receive a faster reply from them. The users you're replying to receive notifications in their [Notification Centre](../profile/your-status-notifications-guide.mdx).

Reactions are helpful when you want to show others that you saw their message. Users whose messages you react to do not receive any notifications.
