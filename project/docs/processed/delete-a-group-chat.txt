    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


If you are a group chat owner and you no longer need the [group chat](./understand-group-chats.mdx), you can [remove all members](./remove-members-from-a-group-chat.mdx) from the group chat and then [leave the group chat](./leave-a-group-chat.mdx).

    [Admonition: Info]
    You can't delete a group chat directly.
