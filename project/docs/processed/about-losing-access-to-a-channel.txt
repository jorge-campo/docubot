    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


There are two types of channels in Status Communities: [open and token-gated](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.mdx).

When you join a community, you automatically get access to all public channels and token-gated channels for which you meet the [token requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.mdx).

In \[open communities, you can access [view-only channels](./about-view-only-channels.mdx)]\(./about-view-only-channels.mdx) even if you're not a community member.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    Token-gated channels show a <LockedIcon /> lock symbol in the channel icon.


## Reasons to lose access to a channel

- You lose access to the community. Check out [About losing access to a community](./about-losing-access-to-a-community.mdx) for more information.
- You no longer [hold the required tokens](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.mdx) for the token-gated channel. If you lose access to a token-gated channel, you must request to [join the channel](./join-a-channel.mdx) again.
