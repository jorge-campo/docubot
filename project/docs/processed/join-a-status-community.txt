    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


A Status Community is a virtual space for like-minded people to exchange ideas and collaborate.

There are different [types of communities](../communities/about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) in Status, and the requirements to join them differ depending on the type. Some communities are open to everyone, while others require holding a specific token or approval by the community Owner.

## What to expect

- You must [share at least one account address](./join-a-status-community.mdx#about-sharing-your-wallet-account-address) from your Status Wallet when joining a community. You can [change the addresses you share](./choose-the-wallet-account-address-you-share-with-a-community.mdx) at any time.
- The aggregated balance of the shared addresses must meet the token requirements of the community you want to join or the [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) you are about to take. For example, if a community requires 100 SNT to join, you must hold at least 100 SNT across all shared addresses.
- After you [request to join](./about-community-request-approvals.mdx) a community, you become a member immediately or you need to wait until the Owner accepts you if the community requires approval.
- For communities requiring join approval, you can view your request status or cancel your pending request on the community page.
- If the community Owner rejects you, you can send a new request to join the community.

    [Admonition: Info]
    You receive a notification in the Status app when the community Owner accepts or rejects you.


## About sharing your Wallet account address

When you join a community, you share one or more of your Status Wallet addresses. This action confirms you have the tokens for token-gated communities or channels, lets you participate in airdrops or fulfil a [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) in the community.

No matter which [type of community](./about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) you want to join, you must share at least one Wallet account address (or address, for short) with the [community control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx). If you have only one address, it's automatically selected when joining the community and you can't unselect this address.

The addresses you share are stored in the community [control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx) and never revealed to the community Owner or members. However, the community Owner might discover their member addresses indirectly.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    Consider creating [dedicated addresses](../wallet/create-wallet-accounts.mdx) for specific communities to protect your security and privacy.


## Join a Status Community

To join token-gated communities, you must hold the required tokens by [buying crypto](../wallet/buy-crypto.mdx) or receiving them from others.

[Mobile Instructions]
1. If someone shares a community with you, tap the link or scan the QR code. Otherwise, from the tab bar, tap "Communities", then tap the community you want to join.
1. Tap "Request to join community". If the button is greyed out, this community is token-gated, and you don't meet its token requirements. You need to obtain the required tokens first.
1. Select "Join as Member/Admin/TokenMaster" to edit your shared addresses. All of your addresses are selected by default, but you can check or uncheck the boxes next to the addresses to adjust your preferences. Optionally, turn off the "Share all current and future addresses" toggle. Then tap "Confirm changes".
1. Tap "For airdrops" to choose your preferred airdrop address. Tap "Confirm changes". There is only one address for airdrops.

    [Admonition: Info]
    An airdrop distributes free tokens, including assets (virtual coins), collectibles (NFTs) and ENS names. In Status, only [community Owners and TokenMasters](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) can airdrop tokens, often to promote or manage their communities.
