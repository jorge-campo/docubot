    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


The [group chat](./understand-group-chats.mdx) owner can remove members from a group chat. As a group chat owner, you're free to decide what's acceptable in your chat and remove members you don't want to see in the conversation. Regular group chat members can't remove other members.

If you remove someone by mistake or change your mind about them later, you can always [re-add them to the chat](./add-members-to-a-group-chat.mdx).

    [Admonition: Info]
    If you remove someone from a group chat, they don't receive a notification. When they open the group chat, they can see a message indicating that they are no longer a member of the group.
