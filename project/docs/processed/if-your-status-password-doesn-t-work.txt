If you are sure you are entering the correct password, but it doesn't work, here are the possible reasons and solutions:

    [Table]
    | Reason | Solution | Notes |
    |---|---|---|
    | Password updates | If you have [changed the password](./change-your-status-password.mdx) on one device, you must sign in with the old password on other devices and manually update the password. | The Status app doesn't automatically sync your password across the devices where you use Status. |
    | Password for a different device | Enter the password you set for this profile on this particular device. | The Status password is device-specific.  If you set different passwords for a specific Status profile on multiple devices, the passwords don't synchronize and work independently. |
    | Password for a different profile | Enter the password you set for this profile on this particular device. | The Status password is profile-specific.    If you have multiple profiles on one device, you can set different passwords for them. |
    | Caps lock | Turn off the "Caps lock" key on your keyboard. | Status passwords are case-sensitive. |
    | Keyboard layout | Set your keyboard to the correct language input for your password. | The keyboard layout can affect the letters and symbols you type. |

Double-check the "Caps lock" being on or an unexpected change in your keyboard layout. You can also try typing your password into a text editor first to confirm that the characters are exactly as intended.
