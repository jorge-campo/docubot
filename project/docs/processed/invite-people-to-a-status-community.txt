    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


Whether you are a community member or not, you can tell people about the community and invite them to join.

    [Admonition: Info]
    People you invite still need to meet the requirements to join [token-gated communities](./understand-token-requirements-in-communities.mdx) and receive the owner's approval in communities with [approval requirements](./about-community-request-approvals.mdx).


## Invite options

There are three approaches to inviting someone.

    [Table]
    | Approach | Description | Works with |
    |---|---|---|
    | Share to Status contacts | Use this option to share the community with people in your Status contact list. | Mobile and desktop |
    | Show QR code | Use this option to show the community QR code to people to scan. | Mobile |
    | Share a link | Use this option to share a link via your other social media, or copy it and share it manually. | Mobile and desktop |
