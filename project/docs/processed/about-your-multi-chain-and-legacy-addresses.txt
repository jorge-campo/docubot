    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    Currenly, you can only share your multi-chain addresses from the Status mobile app.


If you use a multi-chain address to [send](./send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) or [receive](./receive-crypto.mdx) crypto, you can choose faster and cheaper blockchains, such as Arbitrum or Optimism. This helps you save on [gas fees](./understand-network-fees.mdx) and complete transactions more quickly.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Only share your multi-chain address with someone whose wallet supports the same networks. If their wallet doesn't support these networks, they can't send or receive assets correctly using your multi-chain address.


## Your multi-chain and legacy addresses

In essence, your legacy and multi-chain addresses are the same address. If you plan to use Ethereum for your crypto transactions, you can ignore the multi-chain address.

The key difference between your legacy and multi-chain addresses is that your multi-chain address lists the blockchain networks you want to receive crypto on.

These illustrations show examples of address configurations in the Status multi-chain wallet.

`A` A legacy address used solely for Ethereum.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    Notice that the only difference between the legacy and multi-chain addresses are the chain-specific prefixes. The base address is the same.
