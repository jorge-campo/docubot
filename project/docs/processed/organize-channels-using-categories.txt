    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    You can only manage channel categories using Status desktop.


Channel categories help community members locate channels in your community. If you are a community Owner, Admin or TokenMaster, you can create, edit, delete, and reorder categories as needed.

## What to expect

- You can [assign permissions](./set-up-channel-permissions.mdx) to channels, but not to categories.
- To move a channel to a different category, first remove it from its current category, then add it to the new one.
- If you delete a category, its channels automatically go to the top of all categories as uncategorized channels.
