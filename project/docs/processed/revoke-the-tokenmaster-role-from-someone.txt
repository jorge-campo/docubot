title: Revoke the TokenMaster role from someone
author: jorge-campo, cheny0, osmaczko

In Status Communities, Owners can grant the [TokenMaster role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) to others by airdropping them the TokenMaster token. The TokenMaster role in a community is optional, but it can help Owners administer the community tokens, membership and permissions.

When you [airdrop the TokenMaster token](./how-to-airdrop-the-tokenmaster-token.mdx) to someone, they become a TokenMaster and [gain administrative privileges](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) in your community. To revoke this role, you remotely destruct the TokenMaster token in their wallet.

    [Admonition: Info]
    To revoke other types of tokens, read [Revoke a community token from someone](./revoke-a-community-token-from-someone.mdx).


## What to expect

- Destructing the TokenMaster token is a built-in feature of this token, and it's available to community Owners only.
- When you revoke the TokenMaster token, it disappears from the recipient's wallet, and they lose the TokenMaster role immediately. The user receives a notification informing them of your action.
- Community Owners can always destruct the TokenMaster token, even if the token holder is not a community member.
- To revoke the TokenMaster token, you execute a transaction in the [Ethereum blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) and pay a [gas fee](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx).
- If you revoke the TokenMaster role from someone by mistake or change your mind, you can airdrop a new TokenMaster token to them.

## Destroy the TokenMaster token remotely

[Desktop Instructions]
1. From the navigation sidebar, click your community.

1. On top of the channel sidebar, click your community logo and then click "Tokens".

1. Under "Collectibles", select the TokenMaster token, identified by the "TMaster-" prefix and the <TokenSaleDesktopIcon /> crypto-coins icon.

1. Right-click a token holder in the "TokenMaster token holders" area and choose how to revoke their TokenMaster role:

    [Table]
    | Option | Result |
    |---|---|
    | <AirdropDesktopIcon /> Remotely destruct token | Removes the TokenMaster token from the holder's wallet |
    | <WarningDesktopIcon /> Kick | Removes the TokenMaster token from the holder's wallet and kicks out the user from the community |
    | <CancelDesktopIcon /> Ban | Removes the TokenMaster token from the holder's wallet and bans the user from the community |

1. On the next screen, review the transaction "Fees". If you're banning the user, you can optionally "Delete all messages posted by the user" in the community.

1. To confirm, click the "Remotely destruct token" option that you previously chose.

1. Review the transaction details and click "Sign transaction" to destroy the TokenMaster token and revoke the role.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Use the [ban option](./kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community.mdx) cautiously. Banned users can't rejoin the community unless the Owner chooses to lift the ban.
