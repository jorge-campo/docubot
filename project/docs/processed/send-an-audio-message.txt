    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


In Status, anyone in a channel or group chat can send audio messages. You can also send audio messages to your contacts in direct messages (DMs).

You can record an audio message up to one minute long and send as many audio messages as you want.

    [Admonition: Info]
    Deleting an audio message in Status works as deleting any other message. For more details, check out [Edit and delete your messages](./edit-and-delete-messages.mdx).
