    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    The formatting options are not available on Status Web.


You can format text inside your messages to clarify or emphasize something. Formatting can make your messages easier to read, especially if they're long.

In Status, you format your messages using the formatting toolbar or markup by adding special characters.

## Formatting toolbar

To format your text using the formatting toolbar, select the text and choose a formatting option. To format a message you've already sent, [edit the message](./edit-and-delete-messages.mdx). The formatting toolbar is only available on Status desktop.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    When you press "Enter" on your keyboard in Status desktop, you're sending your message. To start a new line, press "Shift+Enter".


## Markup

You can use markup options to format your text in the Status desktop and mobile apps.

    [Table]
    | Format | Markup | Example | Result |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | bold | Surround your text with double asterisks. | \*\*your message\*\* | **your message** |
