    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.


If you clear a chat history, you're clearing all messages in the direct message (DM) chat, group chat or community channel just for yourself. Everyone else can still see the full history.

{/*
For a group chat, only the group chat owner can clear its history for all members. Once you clear the chat history for everyone, there's no way to recover it. If you're not the group chat owner, you clear the chat history just for yourself. Everyone else can still see the full group chat history.
*/}

    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, you can only clear the chat history for a community channel using Status Desktop.
