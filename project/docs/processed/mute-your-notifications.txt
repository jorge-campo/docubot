    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


You can turn off and on your notifications for the entire app or specific communities, channels, group chats or direct message (DM) chats for a designated period. Communities, group chats, channels and DM chats appear greyed out when you mute their notifications.

    [Admonition: Tip]
    You have the option to [set notification exceptions](./set-up-and-customize-notification-exceptions.mdx) to fine-tune your notification preferences, allowing certain notifications to come through while others are muted. For instance, you can mute all notifications for a channel except for messages sent by a specific user.
