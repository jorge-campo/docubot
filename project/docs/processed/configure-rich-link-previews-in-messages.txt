    [Admonition: Beta]
    The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.


    [Admonition: Info]
    Currently, on Status desktop, the option to enable or disable link previews applies to all the links you send. On Status mobile, you can remove the preview each time you send a link.


Rich link previews include the title, description and image of the link, offering more information and visual appeal than the link itself.

Enabling link previews can expose your IP address to the service hosting the link (such as Facebook or YouTube). If you're concerned about privacy, you can turn off the rich link previews.

## What to expect

- In Status, you can control whether your message links include a preview.
- Whether you see a preview for a link sent by someone else depends on their rich link preview setting.
- By default, Status prompts you to choose whether to include a rich link preview each time you send a link.

## Available options on Status mobile and desktop

Options for configuring rich link previews are different on Status mobile and desktop.

    [Table]
    | Option | Status mobile | Status desktop |
    |---|---|---|
    | Configure previews per link | Yes | Yes |
    | Set default behavior for all links | No | Yes |
    | Remove preview after it appears | Yes | Yes |
